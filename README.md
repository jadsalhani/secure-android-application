# Secure Android Application

Recommendations, requirements, and security best practices can be found on different platforms and areas, such as the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/security/best-practices), the [MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) and [MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs) projects.

This project will embody the best practices in an application that will act as a starting template for developers and practitioners to use and reference while building their own applications.
